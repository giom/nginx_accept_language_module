h1. Nginx Accept Language module

This module parses the Accept-Language header and gives the most suitable locale for the user from a list of supported locales from your website.

h3. Syntax

  set_from_accept_language $lang en ja pl;
 -  `$lang` is the variable in which to store the locale
 -  `en ja pl` are the locales supported by your website
  
If none of the locales from accept_language is available on your website, it sets the variable to the first locale of your website's supported locales (in this case en)
  
h4. Caveat

It currently assumes that the accept-language is sorted by quality values (from my tests it's the case for safari, firefox, opera and ie) and discards q (see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). In the situation where I'm using the module, this assumption works... but buyer beware :-)

h3. Example configuration

If you have different subdomains for each languages
<code>
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com;
    set_from_accept_language $lang en ja zh;
    rewrite ^/(.*) http://$lang.your_domain.com redirect;
}
</code>

Or you could do something like this, redirecting people coming to '/' to /en (or /pt)

<code>
location / {
    set_from_accept_language $lang pt en;
     if ( $request_uri ~ ^/$ ) {
       rewrite ^/$ /$lang redirect;
       break;
     }
}
</code>


h3. Why did I create it? 

I'm using page caching with merb on a multi-lingual website and I needed a way to serve the correct language page from the cache
I'll soon put an example on http://gom-jabbar.org
